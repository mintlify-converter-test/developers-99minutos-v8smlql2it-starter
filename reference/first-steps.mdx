## 1\. Register in 99minutos

*   Validate the account to the email received
*   Go to Developers section
*   On API Keys V3 section click on `Generar`
*   After this the `client_id` and `client_secret` will be displayed

Use the credentials to generate access tokens as shown in the [documentation](/reference/oauth_token_create)

**ENVIRONMENTS**

| Production | [https://envios.99minutos.com](https://envios.99minutos.com) | [https://delivery.99minutos.com](https://delivery.99minutos.com) |

`Each environment has an independent set of credentials`

## 2\. Request access to fulfillment

AFTER having your clarification call and the **Fulfill99** service proposal signed, you will receive the documentation.

When you finish reading it, you have to send an email with the following characteristics:  
Subject: **Fulfill99 integration - ‚Äúbrand name‚Äù**

Addressed to the following email = [newsellersfulfillment@99minutos.com](mailto:newsellersfulfillment@99minutos.com)

In the email‚Äôs body, you will add the email addresses of all people who will be added to the slack group to follow up with the integration.

Once this process is done you can continue with the sandbox integration

`Note: if your sandbox tests are successful and you are ready for production, you can contact the previously provided emails and request access to production`
